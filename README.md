## What is Seaborn library?
   
   Seaborn is a Python data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, providing a higher-level interface for creating visually appealing and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies the process of generating complex plots and offers a wide range of built-in functionalities for exploring and presenting data.
   
## Main Features
   
   Some of the things that seaborn does well are:

1. Beautiful Default Styles: Seaborn offers aesthetically pleasing default styles that enhance the visual appeal of plots.
2. High-Level Interface: It provides a high-level API that simplifies the creation of complex plots with fewer lines of code.
3. Integration with Pandas: Seaborn seamlessly integrates with Pandas data structures, allowing for easy data manipulation and visualization.
Abundance of Plot Types: It supports a wide range of plot types, including scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, heatmaps, violin plots, and more.
4. Statistical Estimation: Seaborn incorporates statistical estimation techniques, such as kernel density estimation (KDE), to provide additional insights into the data.
5. Flexible Categorical Plotting: It offers versatile tools for categorical data visualization, including the ability to create grouped bar plots, categorical scatter plots, and more.
6. Sophisticated Color Palettes: Seaborn provides a variety of color palettes that enhance the visual differentiation of data points and facilitate better data interpretation.
7. Visualizing Relationships: It offers functions to explore and visualize relationships between variables, such as scatter plots with regression lines, joint plots, and pair plots.
8. Customizable Themes: Seaborn allows for customization of plot elements, including labels, axes, grids, and titles, to adapt the visual representation to specific requirements.
9. Statistical Annotations: It supports statistical annotations, enabling the addition of significance indicators, confidence intervals, and other statistical information directly on the plots.
